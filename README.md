# Design Patterns
## Introduction
Hello, I am Denis Gonzalez, I'm a python developer. I created this repository with the final 
purpose to learn design pattern. Currently I'm reading **Design Pattern Element of Reusable 
Object-Oriented Software** or better know as **GoF**, and I asked me: How can I practice them?
and the solution is this: A repository where I'll implement every pattern that I learn.
I won't try to explain every pattern, because there are a lot of documentation. I'll just only 
show you how you can implement pattern, but I won't use the typical book examples, I'll try to 
show you an understandable example and encourage you to practice them.

## How can you read every design pattern?
There are many way to classify the design patterns, but the most common way is per purpose, for
this reason, in this repository you're going to find three folder: **Creational**, **Structural** 
and **Behavioral**. 

Inside each folder are the patterns, inside each pattern you're going to find two folder: base and
example folder.
* **base folder:** There are a generic implementation extracted from https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/python,
you can use this like a guide.
* **example folder:** You're going to find a practice example only run the main.py file with python
to see the result. In this same file you'll see the problem and how the pattern can help us.
